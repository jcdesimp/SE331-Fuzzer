SE331-Fuzzer
============

### Requirements
* Must have Ruby 2.0 or newer
* Must have RubyGems installed
* Much have gem "Mechanize" installed

### Usage
```
ruby fuzzer.rb [discover | test] url OPTIONS

COMMANDS:
  discover  Output a comprehensive, human-readable list of all discovered inputs to the system. Techniques include both crawling and guessing.
  test      Discover all inputs, then attempt a list of exploit vectors on those inputs. Report potential vulnerabilities.

OPTIONS:
  --custom-auth=string     Signal that the fuzzer should use hard-coded authentication for a specific application (e.g. dvwa). Optional.

  Discover options:
    --common-words=file    Newline-delimited file of common words to be used in page guessing and input guessing. Required.

  Test options:
    --vectors=file         Newline-delimited file of common exploits to vulnerabilities. Required.
    --sensitive=file       Newline-delimited file data that should never be leaked. It's assumed that this data is in the application's database (e.g. test data), but is not reported in any response. Required.
    --slow=500             Number of milliseconds considered when a response is considered "slow". Default is 500 milliseconds

Examples:
  # Discover inputs
  fuzz discover http://localhost:8080 --common-words=mywords.txt

  # Discover inputs to DVWA using our hard-coded authentication
  fuzz discover http://localhost:8080 --common-words=mywords.txt
```

### Known Issues
* If an invalid URL is given then the program outputs errors
* Inputs are assumed to be well-formed
